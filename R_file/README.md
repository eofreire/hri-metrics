# R_file

Purpose
This folder contains R scripts for plotting/analysing outputs produced by the Octave workflow.

Main script
- `Metrics_correlation.R` — Produces correlation plots/tables from gesture and vocabulary metrics CSVs.

Usage (example)
From repository root or any working directory:
Rscript "R_file/Metrics_correlation.R" --args input="path/to/contingency_table.csv" output="results/"

Dependencies
- R >= 4.0 (install any packages referenced at the top of the script; see script header for package list).

Input
- CSV outputs generated by the Octave workflow (contingency tables and gesture/vocabulary metrics CSVs).

Outputs
- PNG/PDF correlation plots and text files with confidence intervals and p-values (as provided in Supplementary_Material/R_Data examples).
